According to CCI the implementation is too difficult/cumbersome to be used in
an interview - and I agree.

If I were to do this - and the solution in the book confirms this - I would
divide the array evenly into 3 equal sections. Then during an add where there is
capacity in the array, but not in the stack that is being added to we would have
the array be circular such that elements are shifted to make room for the next
element.

This way the array would be using all the capacity possible to store the three
stacks before increasing capacity.
