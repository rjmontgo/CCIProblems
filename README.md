# CCIProblems

This repository will be used to hold all problems I have solved from the Book _Cracking the Coding Interview_ by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

All problems have been implemented part in python and part by handwritten code. 
For the parts that were handwritten there are PDF files within the folders to show my work.
